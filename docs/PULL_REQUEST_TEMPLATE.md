# Title indications (remove this section)
Use prefixes in square brackets to clearly identify the branch of the change (eg. [CORE] for core changes, [BUG] for bugfix, [FEATURE] for a new feature, [UI] for graphic changes...).

Be explicit about when you want feedback, if the Pull Request is work in progress, say so. A prefix of [WIP] in the title is a simple, common pattern to indicate that state, use it on PR title.
